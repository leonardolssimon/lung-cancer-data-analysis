The proposed problem was to statistically assess whether a person, according to their symptoms and lifestyle, has a low, medium or high chance of having lung cancer. For this evaluation, a decision tree was used, which evaluated the historical data of other patients - dataset “cancer_patient_data.csv” - to, from this and the patient's entries/characteristics, determine the result for this individual . In addition to this result, the program displays the most relevant characteristics to arrive at the result of the “exam”, the confusion matrix, which allows you to visualize the performance of the decision tree, a report of the classification algorithm and, finally, its accuracy, which is the number of correct predictions made as a ratio of the total number of predictions made.
Finally, it is worth highlighting the “decision_tree.png” image that is generated to show the decision tree. In it, it is possible to see the nodes, which act as test cases for some attributes, and each edge coming out of these nodes indicates a possible answer for this test. Inside each node there is an entropy data, which serves to measure the purity of a subset of the decision tree, a samples data, which indicates the number of samples in that node, the value, which shows the result of the classification of those samples and , finally, the class, which represents the result of those samples (in this case, 0, 1 or 2, respectively indicating the Low, Medium or High risk of the patient having cancer).
